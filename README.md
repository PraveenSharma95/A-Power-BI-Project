    1. Started with reading the Excel files.
    
    2. Did the data cleaning part with the help of Power-Query Editor.
    
    3. Took help of different cleansing method from replacing nulls to the respective values, removing errors, changing datatype.etc in 
       order to manipulate the data and get the insights out.
    
    4. Also used some of the aggregate functions like sum, average , count along with filters for the aggregation of data to be 
       represented in visualization form.
        
    5. Created the different charts from the table for better understanding of the data
    
    7. Also Designed a interactive dashboard from the charts for better visualisation.
    
    8. Created some useful drop-downs for fetching the required data as per the requirements asked in OBJECTIVE.
